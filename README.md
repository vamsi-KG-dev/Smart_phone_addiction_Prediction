📱 SMARTPHONE ADDICTION PREDICTION USING ENSEMBLE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW  
Smartphone addiction has become a growing concern affecting mental health, productivity, and social well-being.  
This project aims to predict smartphone addiction by analyzing user behavior and smartphone usage patterns using ensemble machine learning techniques.  
By combining multiple machine learning models, the system achieves higher accuracy, robustness, and better generalization compared to individual models.

🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVES  
🔹 Analyze smartphone usage behavior  
🔹 Identify addiction patterns using machine learning  
🔹 Apply ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy  
🔹 Deploy a real-time, user-friendly prediction system
