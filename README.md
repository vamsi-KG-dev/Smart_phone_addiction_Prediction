# 📱 Smartphone Addiction Prediction Machine Learning Model 🧠

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict smartphone addiction based on user behavior and usage patterns. 📊  
Smartphone addiction can negatively impact mental health, productivity, sleep quality, and social interactions. By leveraging machine learning and ensemble techniques, this project aims to identify addiction risk accurately and help promote healthier smartphone usage habits. 🌍✨

## 🔑 Features

The model uses the following features:

1. **screen-time**: ⏱️  
   - Represents the total time spent using a smartphone per day.  
   - **Role**: Higher screen time often indicates excessive usage and increased addiction risk.

2. **app-usage-frequency**: 📲  
   - Measures how frequently applications are opened.  
   - **Role**: Frequent app usage suggests compulsive smartphone behavior.

3. **notification-count**: 🔔  
   - The number of notifications received in a day.  
   - **Role**: High notification frequency can lead to constant phone checking and dependency.

4. **night-time-usage**: 🌙  
   - Tracks smartphone usage during late-night hours.  
   - **Role**: Excessive night usage is linked to poor sleep quality and addiction.

5. **social-media-usage**: 🌐  
   - Time spent on social networking applications.  
   - **Role**: Social media overuse is a major contributor to smartphone addiction.

6. **gaming-time**: 🎮  
   - Time spent playing games on the smartphone.  
   - **Role**: Prolonged gaming can increase screen dependency and addictive behavior.

7. **sleep-disturbance**: 😴  
   - Indicates whether smartphone usage affects sleep patterns.  
   - **Role**: Sleep disruption is a strong indicator of problematic smartphone usage.

8. **daily-check-count**: 🔄  
   - Number of times the phone is checked per day.  
   - **Role**: Frequent checking reflects habitual and addictive behavior.

9. **usage-duration-pattern**: 📈  
   - Describes consistency or irregularity in smartphone usage duration.  
   - **Role**: Irregular and prolonged usage patterns may signal addiction.

10. **addiction-status**: ⚠️  
    - The target variable indicating addiction level.  
    - **Role**: Represents whether the user is classified as Addicted or Not Addicted.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

### Ensemble Techniques
- Random Forest 🌲  
- Voting Classifier 🗳️  
- Bagging 🎒  
- Boosting (AdaBoost / Gradient Boosting) 🚀  

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Ensemble models demonstrated better accuracy and generalization compared to individual machine learning models.

## 🚀 Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Flask / Streamlit to provide real-time predictions.  
Users can input their smartphone usage details and instantly receive addiction prediction results.  
The trained model is stored and loaded using a Pickle (.pkl) file.

## 🎯 Applications

- Identifying smartphone addiction risk  
- Promoting healthy digital habits  
- Supporting mental well-being initiatives  
- Behavioral analysis and research  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration of deep learning models  
- Mobile application development  
- Real-time smartphone usage tracking  
- Multi-level addiction severity classification  
- Cloud-based deployment
